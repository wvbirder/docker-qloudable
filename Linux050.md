## Overview

What is Docker? What is a container?

- Docker is the company and containerization technology.
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com)
- A container is a runtime instance of a docker image: [Container Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=container)

Containers have been around for many years. Docker created a technology that was usable by mere humans, and was much easier to understand than before. Thus, has enjoyed a tremendous amount of support for creating a technology for packaging applications to be portable and lightweight.

### VM vs Container

![](images/050Linux/Picture025-1.png)

While containers may sound like a virtual machine (VM), the two are distinct technologies. With VMs each virtual machine includes the application, the necessary binaries and libraries and the entire guest operating system.

Whereas, Containers include the application, all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers and are not tied to any specific infrastructure, other than having the Docker engine installed on it’s host – allowing containers to run on almost any computer, infrastructure and cloud.

**Note:** At this time, Windows and Linux containers require that they run on their respective kernel base, therefore, Windows containers cannot run on Linux hosts and vice versa.

## Introduction
In this lab we will obtain an Oracle Cloud Trial Account, create ssh key pairs, login into your Trial, create a VCN (Virtual Compute Network) and Compartment, create a new compute instance and finally install docker into the instance.

# Get a Trial Account and Create Infrastructure

You will create all required infrastructure components within your Trail account.

## Obtain a Trial Account

### **Step 1**: Acquire an Oracle Cloud Trial Account

- If you do not have a trial account please click on this URL [cloud.oracle.com/tryit](http://cloud.oracle.com/tryit&intcmp=DeveloperInnovation-HOL-11NOV17), and complete all the required steps to get your free Oracle Cloud Trial Account.

- You will eventually receive the following email after your account has been provisioned:

![](images/050Linux/code_9.png)


### **STEP 2**: Log in to your OCI dashboard

- **You must wait until you receive this email above** indicating that your Cloud Account has been provisioned. _Please note that this email may arrive in your spam or promotions folder pending your email settings._

- Once you receive the **Get Started with Oracle Cloud** Email, make note of your **Username, Password and Cloud Account Name**.

  ![](images/050Linux/0.1.png)

- From any browser go to. :

    [https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in)

- Enter your **Cloud Account Name** in the input field and click the **My Services** button. If you have a trial account, this can be found in your welcome email. Otherwise, this will be supplied by your workshop instructor.

  ![](images/050Linux/1.png)

### **STEP 3**: Create a Compartment

Compartments are used to isolate resources within your OCI tenant. User-based access policies can be applied to manage access to compute instances and other resources within a Compartment.

- Click the **hamburger icon** in the upper left corner to open the navigation menu. Under the **Identity** section of the menu, click **Compartments**

  ![](images/050Linux/69.png)

  ![](images/050Linux/70.png)

  - Click **Create Compartment**

    ![](images/050Linux/7.png)

  - In the **Name** field, enter `Demo`. Enter a **Description** of your choice. Click **Create Compartment**.

    ![](images/050Linux/8.png)

    ![](images/050Linux/8-2.PNG)

  - In a moment, your new Compartment will show up in the list. We will use it next to create components in.

    ![](images/050Linux/9.PNG)

### **STEP 4**: Create a Virtual Compute Network

We need a default VCN to define our networking within the Demo compartment. This is where Subnets and Security Lists, to name a couple get defined for each Availablity Domains in your Tenancy. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is hosted in regions and availability domains. A region is a localized geographic area, and an availability domain is one or more data centers located within a region. A region is composed of several availability domains. Availability domains are isolated from each other, fault tolerant, and very unlikely to fail simultaneously. Because availability domains do not share infrastructure such as power or cooling, or the internal availability domain network, a failure at one availability domain is unlikely to impact the availability of the others.

All the availability domains in a region are connected to each other by a low latency, high bandwidth network, which makes it possible for you to provide high-availability connectivity to the Internet and customer premises, and to build replicated systems in multiple availability domains for both high-availability and disaster recovery.

- Click the **hamburger icon** in the upper left corner to open the navigation menu. Under the **Network** section of the menu, click **Virtual Cloud Networks**

    ![](images/050Linux/10.PNG)

- Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

    ![](images/050Linux/11.PNG)

- Fill in the follow values as highlighted below:

    **NOTE:** Make sure to de-select the "USE DNS HOSTNAMES IN THIS VCN" checkbox)

    ![](images/050Linux/12.PNG)

    ![](images/050Linux/13.PNG)

- Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

- Click **Close** on the details page:

    ![](images/050Linux/14.PNG)

- You will see:

    ![](images/050Linux/15.PNG)

### **STEP 5**: Add a Security List entry

A security list provides a virtual firewall for an instance, with ingress and egress rules that specify the types of traffic allowed in and out. Each security list is enforced at the instance level. However, you configure your security lists at the subnet level, which means that all instances in a given subnet are subject to the same set of rules. The security lists apply to a given instance whether it's talking with another instance in the VCN or a host outside the VCN.

- Click on the **DockerVCN** and then **Security Lists**

    ![](images/050Linux/16.PNG)

    ![](images/050Linux/17.PNG)

- Click on **Default Security List for DockerVCN**

    ![](images/050Linux/18.PNG)

For the purposes of the upcoming Docker deployments we need to add three Ingress Rules that allow access from the Internet to ports 9080, 8002, and 8085. In the production environment only the UI port (8085) would typically be opened for access but the labs will have us test the various other Docker container functionallity as we go, thus the need to open three ports.

- Click **Edit All Rules** and then select **+Add Rule**

    ![](images/050Linux/19.PNG)

    ![](images/050Linux/20.PNG)

- **Enter the following**

**NOTE:** Leave all other values at default

```
Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
Destination Port Range: 8085 
```

- **Add two more Ingress Rules**

```
Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
Destination Port Range: 8085 
```

```
Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
Destination Port Range: 8085 
```

- When completed your rules should look like:

    ![](images/050Linux/21.PNG)

- Click the **Save Secutiry List Rules** button

    ![](images/050Linux/22.PNG)

- Your Ingress Rules should look like:

    ![](images/050Linux/23.PNG)

### **STEP 6**: Create SSH Key Pair (Linux or Mac client)

Before we create the Compute instance that will contian Docker and application depoyments we need to create an ssh key pair so we'll be able to securly connect to the instance and do the Docker installation, etc.

**NOTE:** `This step focuses on key pair generation for Linux or Mac based terminal sessions. If your going to run your terminal sessions from a Windows client then skip to STEP 7`

- In a `Linux/Mac` client terminal window **Type** the following (You don't have to worry about any passphrases unless you want to enter one)

```
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f dockerkey
```

- Your key pair is now in the current directory

    ![](images/050Linux/24.PNG)

### **STEP 7**: Create SSH Key Pair (Windows client)

For Windows clients this example will show the use of PuttyGen to generate the keypair. [Putty and PuttyGen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) are available for download.

- Run **PuttyGen** and click **Generate**

    ![](images/050Linux/25.PNG)

- **Save private key** to a directory of your choice.

**NOTE:** `Do not save the public key as the format is not compatable with Linux openSSH.

- Instead, **Select the entire Public Key in the display and right-click copy**. `This content will be pasted into the Create Instance dialog in Step 8.`

    ![](images/050Linux/25-2.PNG)

- **NOTE for Linux and Mac Clients:** Just open up the pubic key file in an editor (vi) and select / copy the entire contents to be used in Step 8.   

    ![](images/050Linux/25-4.PNG)

### **STEP 8**: Create a Compute Instance

You will now create a Linux based Compute instance using the public key you just generated.

- Go back to your OCI console and from the hamburger menu in the upper left hand corner select **Compute-->Instances**

    ![](images/050Linux/26.PNG)

-Click **Create Instance**

   ![](images/050Linux/27.PNG)

- **Select or Type** the following in the `Instance` section of the dialog:

```
Name: Docker
Availability Domain: xxx-AD-1
Boot Volume: Oracle-Provided OS Image
Image Operating System: Oracle Linux 7.5
Shape Type: Virtual Machine
Shape: VM.Standard1.1
SSH Keys: Choose SSH Key Files
```

- You will Browse and select your PUBLIC SSH Key
**NOTE:** You will paste the public key you copied in Step 7 into the SSH KEY field by selecting the "Paste SSH Keys" radio button. `The public key should all be on ONE LINE` 

   ![](images/050Linux/28.PNG)

- In the Network Section **Select** the following:

```
Virtual Cloud Network: DockerVCN
```

   ![](images/050Linux/29.PNG)

- Click **Create Instance**

After a few minutes you should see a running instance with a Public IP Address.

- `Make a note of the IP Address as we will be using this in the next step.`

   ![](images/050Linux/30.PNG)


### **STEP 8**: SSH into the Instance and install Docker

The last set up piece will be to SSH into the Compute image and install Docker.

- For a Windows client session bring up Putty, select the **Session** section and type in the IP address:

   ![](images/050Linux/31.PNG)

- Select the **Data** section and enter the following as the username:

```
opc
```

- Screenshot:

  ![](images/050Linux/32.PNG)

- Select **SSH-->Auth** and browse to the Private Key you created back in Step 7:

   ![](images/050Linux/33.PNG) 

- Click the **Open** button. You will presented the first time with am alert message. Click **Yes**

   ![](images/050Linux/35.PNG)

- You will logged into the Compute image:

   ![](images/050Linux/36.PNG)

- **NOTE:** For Linux and Mac client sessions "cd" into the directory where your key pair is. Make sure the dockerkey file has the permissions of "600" (chmod 600 dockerkey) and ssh into the compute instance `substituting your IP address`.

Example:

```
cd <directory of your key pair>
chmod 600 dockerkey
ssh -i ./dockerkey opc@129.213.119.105
```

### **STEP 9**: Install and configure Docker and GIT

Docker and GIT are required for the subsuquent labs. You will install the Docker engine, enable it to start on re-boot, grant docker privledges to the `opc` user and finally install GIT.

- **Type** the following:

```
sudo -s
yum install docker-engine
usermod -aG docker opc
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker
```
- Screenshot at the end of the Docker installation:

   ![](images/050Linux/38.PNG)

   ![](images/050Linux/39.PNG)

- **Type** the following:

```
yum install git
```

- Screenshot at the end of the GIT installation:

   ![](images/050Linux/40.PNG)

- **Type** the following:

```
su - opc
docker version
docker images
git --version
```

- If the following commands run without error as the `opc` user then you are ready to proceed to Lab 100.
